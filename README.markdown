 A multi-item card carousel in Vue. It was fun thinking about how this should be viewed from the perspective of a component. It basically takes a window size and increases/decreases the pagination window  on each click, which updates a style which translates the images. Values are hardcoded for demonstration but it could be made generic via props :)
